# MERN Todo Application - Backend Service

This repository contains only the backend code for the MERN Todo Application.

**Status:** Historical / Archived. This repository is no longer the main development location for the project.

**Description:**
This Node.js/Express backend provides the API endpoints for managing todo items, including operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos. It interacts with a MongoDB database.

**Technologies Used:**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* MongoDB

**IMPORTANT:**
The complete MERN Todo Application, including the frontend, backend, and Docker Compose configuration for running the full application, is now managed in a separate repository.

**Please refer to the main project repository for the latest code and instructions on how to set up and run the full application:**

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (if applicable) and provide your MongoDB connection string.
